# Multi-Label-Classification-Task
Classifying Wine Varieties through Dimension Reduction technique PCA with SVM, Random Forest, Multi-Nominal Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting Classifier, Naive Bayes, and K Nearest Neighbour. 

Wine Data
This report addresses the classification of 3 wine varieties derived from regions of three different cultivators in Italy. The dataset had target class as Label which was to be predicted with respect to its independent 13 attributes namely the chemical constituents found at different levels in Wine. Using the 13 attributes, we were to determine out of the 6 classifiers i.e., Logistic regression, Random Forest, Naïve Bayes, Support Vector Machine, Gradient Boosting, and K-Nearest Neighbour. However, to extract maximum level of information from the 13 attributes to correctly classify, Principal Component Analysis were used. A perfect accuracy was achieved when PCA was classified with Naïve Bayes resulting in all true positives for the wine dataset.
